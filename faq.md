# Oppr.ai FAQ Content (Verbatim)

## Category: General Questions

1. **What is Oppr's core purpose for manufacturing?**
   - Oppr is an AI-driven platform designed specifically for manufacturing operations. It bridges the critical gap between raw machine data and human shop-floor expertise, helping manufacturers enhance efficiency, reduce downtime, and unlock hidden operational value.

2. **Who is Oppr designed to help?**
   - While our platform is scalable for enterprises, we have a deep focus on SME manufacturers. We empower frontline operators, plant managers, and quality engineers with digital tools that make their daily work easier and more data-driven.

3. **What manufacturing challenges does Oppr.ai help solve?**
   - We address fragmented data capture, the 'brain drain' caused by retiring expertise, slow root-cause analysis, and the difficulty of converting anecdotal shop-floor observations into standardized, actionable operational knowledge.

4. **What is the pricing model?**
   - Oppr uses a scalable SaaS subscription model tailored to your facility size and the modules you need (LOGS, DOCS, or IDA). We aim to provide rapid ROI by focusing on high-impact areas of your production.

5. **How long does implementation take?**
   - Most implementations follow a 4-phase approach: Knowledge Risk Assessment (Week 1), Single-Line Pilot (Week 2–4), Analysis & Recommendations (Week 5–6), and Scale What Works (Week 7–8+). You’ll see measurable value within 8 weeks—no lengthy IT project required.

6. **Will operators actually use it?**
   - This is the most common concern—and our biggest differentiator. LOGS was designed so that capturing knowledge takes 20 seconds via voice or photo. Operators don’t stop working to fill in forms. If they can send a voice message, they can use LOGS. Training takes 15 minutes. We consistently see high adoption because we removed the friction that killed every previous system.

7. **What ROI can we expect?**
   - Results vary by operation, but typical outcomes include 50% scrap reduction, 90% less logging time, 35% downtime reduction, and ROI within 8 weeks. Often, a single prevented failure pays for the entire first year of the platform.

8. **What industries do you serve?**
   - Oppr serves discrete and process manufacturing across sectors including food & beverage, chemicals, plastics, metals, packaging, and equipment manufacturing. Any operation where human knowledge matters alongside machine data is a fit.

9. **What’s the difference between Oppr Insights and the full platform?**
   - Oppr Insights is a standalone diagnostic tool that gathers strategic feedback from your workforce—asynchronously, in any language, with AI-powered analysis. It helps you discover where the biggest opportunities are before you invest in solving them. The full Oppr platform (LOGS + IDA + DOCS) is the execution engine that captures, analyzes, and implements improvements continuously.

## Category: Features & Capabilities

1. **What are the core modules within the platform?**
   - Our ecosystem consists of three parts: LOGS for effortless real-time data capture, DOCS for centralizing and searching operational knowledge/SOPs, and IDA—our AI Co-Pilot that analyzes patterns and predicts issues before they cause downtime.

2. **How does IDA utilize Artificial Intelligence?**
   - IDA uses advanced LLMs and pattern recognition to identify correlations between machine events and human observations. It can summarize shifts, suggest root causes, and allow you to 'talk' to your factory data in natural language.

3. **Can I include images or videos in the reports?**
   - Absolutely. Multi-modal input is core to Oppr. Operators can quickly snap photos or record short videos of issues, which are then timestamped, tagged, and analyzed by the AI for full contextual traceability.

4. **Does Oppr have a mobile application?**
   - Yes, the platform is optimized for tablets and smartphones, allowing operators to log data and access DOCS directly at the machine side without needing to walk to a central office station.

5. **How is Oppr different from connected worker platforms?**
   - Connected worker platforms digitize existing workflows—digital forms, checklists, work orders. Oppr captures something entirely different: the unstructured human knowledge that no form can capture. The observation that “the material looks different.” The adjustment that always works on humid days. We don’t replace your connected worker tools—we add the layer they’re missing.

6. **How is Oppr different from knowledge management systems?**
   - Traditional knowledge management requires people to stop working and document what they know. The result is usually a SharePoint nobody visits. Oppr captures knowledge in the flow of work—voice logs, photos, observations—without requiring operators to change how they work. The AI structures, tags, and connects it automatically.

## Category: Security & Integration

1. **How does Oppr ensure data privacy and security?**
   - Data security is our top priority. We are fully GDPR compliant and use enterprise-grade encryption. Your operational data is kept in private environments and is never used to train public AI models.

2. **Does Oppr integrate with our existing tech stack?**
   - Yes, Oppr is designed to layer over your existing systems. We can connect with common PLC/SCADA systems via standard protocols and export data to your existing ERP or BI tools for higher-level reporting.

3. **How long does a typical setup take?**
   - One of our key advantages is rapid deployment. A basic LOGS and DOCS setup can be operational in as little as a few days, with the AI IDA engine becoming increasingly helpful as it learns from your specific operations over the first few weeks.

4. **Does Oppr integrate with our MES, SCADA, or historian?**
   - Yes, but integration is optional—not required. Oppr delivers immediate value as a standalone system. When you’re ready, we connect to common historians (OSIsoft PI, Wonderware), MES systems, and SCADA via standard protocols. Integration enhances analysis by combining human observations with machine data, but you don’t need it to start.
