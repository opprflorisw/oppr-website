The Data Gap: Why the “Why” Is So Hard to Capture

Last month, I was walking through a client’s plant when the line suddenly stopped.

Everyone turned to the dashboard.
 Alarms lit up like a Christmas tree.

“Pressure dropped.”
 “Line 3 stopped.”
 “Temperature HIGH.”

The data told us what happened.

But the person who solved it didn’t look at a single screen.
One of the senior operators walked over, listened for a second, and said quietly:

“That bearing sounds different.”

Ten minutes later, maintenance confirmed the issue — a failing coupling.

No sensor caught it.
No dashboard flagged it.
Only experience did.

That’s when it hit me:
 
We’re flooded with machine data, but we’re blind to human data.
 The insights, observations, and instincts that operators have — the “why” behind the “what” — are the missing link in every plant’s optimization story.

But why is the ‘why’ so hard to capture?

1️⃣ Tools with High Barriers:
 Documentation happens at a desk, long after the context is gone.
2️⃣ Disconnected Silos:
 Notes, spreadsheets, and “tribal knowledge” live everywhere except where decisions are made.
3️⃣ Aging Workforce:
 Every retirement takes decades of untapped insight with it.

💡 Here’s the shift we need:
 Stop treating this as a documentation problem.
 Start seeing it as an intelligence opportunity.

Humans are the most advanced sensors in any factory.
 
If we can make capturing their insights as easy as speaking to a device or taking a quick photo — we finally connect the WHAT with the WHY.

That’s when operations stop just reacting — and start learning.
👂 What’s one “human insight” that saved the day in your operations?
