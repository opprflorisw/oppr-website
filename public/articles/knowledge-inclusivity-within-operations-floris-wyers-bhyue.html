  <div><h2>🛠️ The role of the operations manager...</h2><p>Having worked in various organizations, my ultimate goal was always to achieve an organization confident in its secure, efficient, and smooth operations without constant concerns. This requires robust systems and processes for predictable daily production, effective risk management, and swift adaptability to changes, allowing you to focus on strategic objectives rather than getting bogged down by operational issues.</p><p>Reality is that an operations managers more than often find themselves in  firefighting mode, reacting to and correcting problems as they arise on the floor. From my experience, I see a recurring scenario unfold: a continuous cycle of reacting to unforeseen issues that appear as new challenges. Yet, these "new" problems are frequently not new at all but recurring issues disguised by a lack of shared knowledge.</p><p>My initial solution was to log issues, believing that recording these incidents would improve the reactions to these situations in the future. However, as the complexity and volume of issues grew, maintaining these logs in spreadsheets became an overwhelming task, transforming the solution into a bottleneck rather than a remedy. On top of that, as my expectations of what this list would do grew, and the expecting others to log details exactly as I envisioned proved impractical. This led me to realize that increasing the quality and usability of this list wasn't going to be achieved by just increasing my own efforts. And, it contradicted the essence of operational peace of mind, which is about trusting in your processes and team, not shouldering everything individually.</p><h3>🌉The gap</h3><p>I discovered that there is a gap between what managers, engineers, and operators expect and what they can actually deliver. Each person has unique operational knowledge needs and contributes based on their expertise. The true challenge isn't just logging issues and trying to create complex analyses but fostering a culture where knowledge is shared openly, information is easily accessible, and everyone can contribute at their comfort level.</p><p>To address this challenge, we must prioritize knowledge collection and sharing. The solutions often already lie within our teams, yet they remain isolated, either in hard to find documents or within a few experienced individuals. This dependency is too risky.</p><p>We must collect this expertise and knowledge and make it available to all within the organization. And using AI is the perfect way to assist all different stakeholders.</p><h2>🔄Changing the approach to knowledge</h2><p>I commonly hear this from managers I talk to: <em>"Why change operations that have worked for 50 years?"</em> The answer lies in being able to look further than your current operations and understand that the industrial landscape is rapidly evolving. </p><p>Organizations relying on legacy systems face increasing challenges as the sector shifts towards more diverse teams, advanced automation, digital systems, and stricter regulations. Adapting is essential to remain competitive and efficient in this changing environment.</p><h3>⏳Why Change Is Essential Now</h3><p>We're witnessing rapid shifts in both technology, workforce and regulations. Adapting to these changes is not just vital for staying competitive—it's essential for survival in an evolving industrial landscape:</p><ul><li><p>🤖As <strong>technologies and machinery advance</strong> in sophistication, management demands improved data and knowledge gathering to boost operational efficiency. AI's growing reliability presents significant opportunities to equip your workforce with the essential knowledge they need.</p></li><li><p>👷‍♂️The <strong>workforce is evolving</strong> with the influx of tech-savvy Gen Z, demanding a shift from traditional work styles to collaborative and digital environments. Embracing their digital skills and openness to change is essential for overcoming challenges such as an aging workforce and increased performance pressure. Integrating AI to enhance operational efficiency and innovation is necessary, and using the new workforce will be essential to create a culture of continuous improvement and increase workforce engagement and health.</p></li><li><p>📜The <strong>increasing number of rules and regulations</strong> requires thorough documentation of all knowledge and data, covering areas such as environmental permits, corporate sustainability objectives (SDGs), and client requirements for supplier transparency and certification. AI offers solutions to alleviate the burden of these escalating demands.</p></li></ul><h3>📚The Crucial Role of Knowledge Management</h3><p>Adapting to change and ensuring operations remain flexible and current requires a platform that can adjust to both external and internal changes. The cornerstone of effective operation is the efficient management of information, knowledge, and expertise. Our goal is to foster an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute to, access, and collaboratively engage with knowledge.</p><h2>🌐Introducing Oppr, Knowledge Inclusivity for Operational Environments</h2><p>Oppr is transforming how operational knowledge is shared and accessed, empowering both field and desk personnel to contribute and get the right knowledge at the right time to make the right decision.</p><p>Oppr democratizes access to expertise, allowing all team members to contribute to and improve the collective knowledge base.
