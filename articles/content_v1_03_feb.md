## 1. HOMEPAGE (`/`)

### **Hero Section**
- **Label:** The Digital Operator Platform
- **Headline:** The *what* from machines. The *why* from people. Together.
- **Description:** Manufacturing is machines and people working together. We've invested millions in capturing machine data—sensors everywhere. But what operators know? That's never been captured properly. Until now.
- **CTAs:** 
  - Book a Demo
  - See How It Works

### **Problem Section**
- **Label:** The Problem
- **Headline:** The Human Data Gap in Manufacturing
- **Sub-headline:** We've digitized the machines, but we've forgotten the people who run them.
- **Points:**
  - **The Missing Context:** Sensors tell you *that* a machine stopped. They cannot tell you *why* an operator had to kick the side of it to get it started again.
  - **The Silent Crisis:** 70% of operational knowledge is undocumented. When your most experienced operators retire, decades of expertise walk out the door.
  - **The Documentation Trap:** SOPs are often out of date the day they are printed. Real-world solutions rarely make it back into the official records.

### **Platform Section**
- **Label:** The Platform
- **Headline:** Three modules. One closed loop.
- **Sub-headline:** The Oppr platform contains 3 modules that work together in a continuous loop—from capture to investigation to action, and back again.

## 2. HOW IT WORKS (`/how-it-works`)

### **Header**
- **Headline:** How It Works
- **Sub-headline:** The Digital Operator Platform. Connecting the human world of the shop floor to the machine world of data.

### **The Two Worlds**
- **Headline:** Two Worlds That Need to Connect
- **Machine World:** Sensors, PLCs, SCADA, Historians. Precise but context-blind. Tells you WHAT happened.
- **Human World:** Experience, intuition, "feel", tricks of the trade. Rich in context but invisible to systems. Tells you WHY it happened.
- **The Gap:** The knowledge gap between these worlds is where most operational waste, safety risks, and lost expertise live.

### **The Unified Timeline**
- **Headline:** The Unified Timeline
- **Description:** Most systems only record machine events. Oppr creates a unified timeline where human observations are correlated with machine data.
- **Timeline Items (Examples):**
  - **Machine event:** Line 3 Downtime (E-Stop)
  - **Human observation:** "Noticed unusual vibration on motor casing prior to stop."
  - **IDA Insight:** Correlation between heat signature and operator observation confirms bearing failure.

### **The Modules**
- **LOGS (Capture):** Operators speak observations in 20 seconds. Any language. Natural speech. "The pump sounds higher pitched than usual." Captured, transcribed, and tagged automatically.
- **IDA (Investigate):** Our Investigation & Diagnostic Assistant. Ask IDA questions in plain English: "When did we last see this quality issue on Line 2?" Get answers from combined human + machine data.
- **DOCS (Preserve):** Turn fleeting observations into living documentation. IDA helps synthesize patterns into SOPs and training materials that stay current because they reflect reality.

### **The Closed Loop**
- **Analyze:** Patterns identified across shifts.
- **Act:** Knowledge shared and problems solved.
- **Preserve:** Lessons learned become part of the system.
- **The Value Compounds:** The more you capture, the smarter the system becomes.

### **Getting Started**
- **Timeline:** 2-3 Weeks from Discovery to Deployment.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Discovery:** We identify where the biggest "knowledge gaps" are in your operation.
  2. **Pilot:** A single line or department starts capturing observations.
  3. **Expand:** Once ROI is proven, we roll out across the facility.
- **Key Advantages:**
  - No IT Project Required
  - Optional Machine Integration
  - Minimal Training Needed
  - Quick ROI

## 3. OPPR INSIGHTS (`/insights`)

### **Hero Section**
- **Headline:** Turn Workforce Feedback into Operational Intelligence
- **Sub-headline:** Stop guessing. Start asking. Oppr Insights lets you gather strategic feedback from every operator, in every language, to identify the real bottlenecks.
- **CTA:** Try Insights for Free

### **Human-Centric Intelligence**
- **Headline:** Intelligence from the People Who Know Best
- **Description:** Your operators see every inefficiency, safety risk, and quality issue before they show up in the data. Oppr Insights gives you a high-resolution window into their collective knowledge.
- **Points:**
  - **Asynchronous Pulse:** Don't wait for quarterly meetings. Get real-time feedback on specific initiatives or general operations.
  - **Multilingual Clarity:** Operators respond in their native language—AI handles the translation and sentiment analysis.
  - **Insight Extraction:** Don't read 500 responses. AI synthesizes the feedback into actionable themes and quantified opportunities.

### **The Challenge Section**
- **The Suggestion Box Problem:** Traditional feedback loops are slow, paper-based, and rarely result in visible action.
- **The Communication Barrier:** Language gaps and hierarchy prevent the most valuable insights from reaching leadership.
- **The Data Silence:** We have plenty of machine data, but zero structured data on human sentiment and qualitative observations.

### **CI Case Study Example**
- **Text:** "We used Oppr Insights to ask about our changeover process. In 48 hours, we identified a mechanical bottleneck that had been ignored for 2 years because it wasn't 'in the data'." — Continuous Improvement Lead

## 5. FOR SME MANUFACTURERS (`/solutions/sme`)

### **Header**
- **Title:** SME Manufacturers
- **Headline:** Professional Operations without the IT Overhead
- **Tagline:** Your first real operational intelligence system. No IT department required.

### **Challenges:**
- **Still on Paper and Excel:** Valuable data is trapped in binders and spreadsheets that nobody reads.
- **Knowledge in a Few Heads:** If a key operator is out sick, the line performance drops.
- **Investigation Takes Too Long:** When a quality issue happens, it takes days to figure out why.

### **Features:**
- **Capture Knowledge Without Stopping Work:** Operators speak observations in 20 seconds—in any language. Take a photo of something unusual. No forms, no logins, no training. Knowledge gets captured because capturing it takes no extra time.
- **Find Answers Without Analysts:** “When did we last see this quality issue?” Ask questions in plain language and get answers instantly. No database queries, no digging through files. Anyone can investigate.
- **Procedures That Reflect Reality:** Your SOPs probably describe how things should work, not how they actually work. Oppr builds living documentation from what your people actually do.

### **Economic Comparison:**
- **Enterprise Systems Require:** €200K-500K implementation, 6-12 month deployment, Dedicated IT resources, Complex integrations, Training programs.
- **Oppr Requires:** Affordable monthly pricing, Deployed in 2-3 weeks, No IT involvement, No integrations required to start, 15-minute operator onboarding.
- **ROI Note:** Most SME customers see positive ROI within 3-4 months through reduced repeat troubleshooting, faster root cause identification, and preserved knowledge.

## 6. FOR ENTERPRISE (`/solutions/enterprise`)

### **Header**
- **Title:** Enterprise Manufacturers
- **Headline:** The Human Data Layer for Global Operations
- **Tagline:** The missing piece in your Industry 4.0 stack.

### **Challenges:**
- **Massive Investment, Persistent Gap:** You've spent millions on MES and SAP, but still have no data on human observations.
- **Islands of Human Knowledge:** Expertise is trapped within individual sites. Best practices don't transfer across the network.
- **The "Why" is Missing:** You know exactly *when* downtime occurs, but the root cause requires a team of analysts and weeks of time.

### **Integration Model:**
- **Existing Stack:** Historians, MES, SCADA, CMMS, Analytics.
- **Oppr (The Missing Layer):** Human Observations, Context, Expertise, The "Why".
- **Complete Picture:** What + Why, Correlated, Queryable.

### **Enterprise Use Cases:**
- **Cross-Site Knowledge Transfer:** All sites capture observations on the same platform. Best practices emerge from actual performance data. Living knowledge transfers, not dead documents.
- **Accelerated Root Cause Analysis:** Operator observations from the time of incidents are already captured. Investigation time drops from weeks to hours.
- **Expertise Preservation at Scale:** Knowledge capture becomes automatic across all facilities. When expertise walks out the door, observations and patterns remain.

## 7. FOR CONSULTANTS (`/solutions/consultants`)

### **Header**
- **Title:** Operational Excellence Consultants
- **Headline:** The Infrastructure That Makes Your Work Stick
- **Tagline:** Move from binders that collect dust to infrastructure that drives results.

### **Challenges:**
- **Improvements Don't Stick:** You design a great process, but it degrades within months of your departure.
- **Documentation Goes Stale:** SOPs are created during the engagement but never updated by the team.
- **Data Gathering is Slow:** You spend 50% of your engagement time just trying to understand "what's actually happening."

### **Consultant Workflow with Oppr:**
- **During the Engagement (Capture at Scale):** Every operator contributes observations continuously. You analyze 400 observations from 45 operators, not interviews with 15 people.
- **For Root Cause (Human Context Ready):** Operator observations from the time of the issue already captured. Contemporaneous data, not reconstructed memories.
- **After the Engagement (Sustainability Built In):** System continues capturing. Best practices embedded in living documentation. Your work produces infrastructure, not just documents.

### **Differentiation:**
- "We're the consultants who leave infrastructure, not just playbooks. When we finish an engagement, you have a system that continues capturing knowledge, maintaining documentation, and enabling root cause analysis—not binders that collect dust."

## 8. FOR PRIVATE EQUITY (`/solutions/private-equity`)

### **Header**
- **Title:** Private Equity Investors
- **Headline:** Systematic Operational Value Creation
- **Tagline:** Standardize knowledge capture. Accelerate the value creation plan.

### **Challenges:**
- **Information Asymmetry:** In the first 100 days, you don't know what you don't know about the operation.
- **Key Person Risk:** The value of the asset often lives in the heads of 2-3 key people near retirement.
- **Time Is Scarce:** Every month spent "diagnosing" is a month lost in the holding period.

### **Value Drivers:**
1. **Rapid Operational Diagnostics:** Within weeks, visibility into what operators actually know—problems, improvement ideas, knowledge gaps. (4-8 weeks to actionable insights)
2. **Knowledge Preservation:** Capture tacit expertise before key people leave. Make institutional knowledge an actual asset. (Ongoing from day one)
3. **Accelerated Problem Resolution:** Investigation time drops 60-75%. Faster resolution means less production impact, better margins. (Immediate once deployed)
4. **Cross-Portfolio Learning:** Patterns at one company can transfer to others. Portfolio becomes a network where operational learning compounds. (Emerging with multiple deployments)

### **Value Creation Projection:**
- For a PE firm with 10 manufacturing portfolio companies averaging €75M revenue each, systematic operational knowledge capture typically generates €5-15M in aggregate value creation over a 5-year hold period—often with platform investment payback in the first year.

## 9. FOR EQUIPMENT OEMS (`/solutions/oem`)

### **Header**
- **Title:** Equipment Manufacturers & Machine Builders
- **Headline:** Deliver "Pre-Installed Intelligence"
- **Tagline:** Don't just sell hardware. Sell a machine that knows how to talk to operators.

### **Challenges:**
- **The Black Hole:** Once the machine is installed, you lose visibility into how it's actually used.
- **Reactive Service Revenue:** Support calls are expensive and frustrating when the operator can't describe the problem clearly.
- **Training Fatigue:** Customers struggle to keep their operators trained on your complex equipment.

### **Concept:** Every production line you sell comes with Oppr pre-configured—ready to capture operator knowledge from day one.

### **Benefits:**
- **What Your Customers Get:** Turn-key knowledge capture from day one, no separate implementation project, system that understands their equipment, enhanced support with captured context.
- **What You Get:** Visibility into field performance, proactive service capability, new recurring revenue stream, product improvement insights.

### **OEM Use Cases:**
- **Enhanced Service Delivery:** Before service calls, review operator observations. Technicians arrive informed. Higher first-time fix rate.
- **Proactive Maintenance Programs:** Operator observations surface early warning signs. Offer proactive maintenance before breakdown.
- **Continuous Training Reinforcement:** Training content accessible via QR codes on equipment. New operators learn from accumulated knowledge.

## 10. EXAMPLES (`/examples`)

### **Header**
- **Headline:** See Oppr in Action
- **Tagline:** Real scenarios showing how human observations change outcomes. Each example shows what happens with and without the ability to capture and correlate operator knowledge.

### **Scenario 1: The Bearing That Sounded Different (Maintenance)**
- **Situation:** A production line bearing is beginning to fail. Vibration sensors are within normal range. An operator notices a higher-pitched sound.
- **Without Oppr:** Maria notices sound on Day 1. Different operator on Day 3 is unaware. Bearing fails catastrophically on Day 8. Outcome: €55,000 repairs + lost production.
- **With Oppr:** Maria voice-logs sound on Day 1 (20 sec). Observation visible to all shifts. IDA correlates rising vibration with Maria's note on Day 5. Bearing replaced in scheduled window on Day 6. Outcome: €800 planned replacement. Zero downtime.

### **Scenario 2: The Material That Looked Different (Quality)**
- **Situation:** Batch of material meets COA specs but texture feels wrong.
- **Without Oppr:** Morning operator notices 'grainy' texture, adjusts settings. Afternoon operator uses standard settings. Quality issues begin. 2 days of investigation to find root cause. Outcome: €30,000 scrap.
- **With Oppr:** Morning operator logs graininess with photo. Afternoon operator sees note, maintains settings. Shift summary includes observation. Root cause found in minutes when issues arise. Outcome: Minimal scrap.

### **Scenario 3: The Expert Who Retired (Knowledge)**
- **Situation:** Hans, lead tech of 28 years, is retiring in 6 months.
- **Without Oppr:** HR schedules 'knowledge transfer sessions'. Hans shares what he remembers. After he leaves, a strange issue on Line 4 causes months of struggle. Outcome: 28 years of expertise lost.
- **With Oppr:** Hans logs observations naturally for 18 months before retiring. 400+ observations captured. Query: 'Line 4 problems humidity' surfaces his expertise. Outcome: Knowledge preserved and teachable.

### **Scenario 4: The Problem That Kept Coming Back (Efficiency)**
- **Situation:** Foam overflow during product changeover happens monthly.
- **Without Oppr:** Teams solve it from scratch each time. Solution forgotten by next occurrence. No institutional learning. Outcome: Same problem solved 12+ times per year.
- **With Oppr:** Team logs solution with photo in Jan (2 min). Feb operator searches and finds solution instantly. IDA identifies pattern in March. April: Preventative procedure established. Outcome: Solved once, learned permanently.

### **Scenario 5: The Humidity Nobody Measured (Pattern Recognition)**
- **Situation:** Intermittent quality issues correlate with 'muggy' weather, but there's no sensor.
- **Without Oppr:** Quality team analyzes sensors, finds nothing. Install sensor and wait months for data. Outcome: 6+ months to identify pattern.
- **With Oppr:** Operators log 'humid today', 'sticky' notes. IDA query surfaces pattern in days. Correlation confirmed: 80% of issues on 'muggy' days. Outcome: Adjustment found in days.

### **Scenario 6: The Shift Handover That Worked (Communication)**
- **Situation:** Information lost between three shifts.
- **Without Oppr:** Verbal handoffs are lossy. Paper logs lack context. Important details ('Line 2 finicky') ignored. Outcome: Context lost at every handover.
- **With Oppr:** Real-time logging throughout shift. IDA generates automatic summary for incoming team. Line 2 context is clear and actionable. Outcome: Continuity maintained.
