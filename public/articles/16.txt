The hype around "sexy" Industry 4.0 is over. The focus is shifting from futuristic tech to practical, current solutions that address real-world challenges on the shop floor.

A recent IndustryWeek analysis of the Rockwell Automation 2025 "State of Smart Manufacturing Report" highlights this shift perfectly. It’s not about AI for AI's sake; it's about empowering the people who run the factory.

Here’s why Oppr.ai's operator-first approach is more relevant than ever:

The Challenge is Application, Not Just Tech:

"No one gets credit for or gets to feel special for using AI, the challenge is figuring out the best ways to apply it."

Transformation Starts with Your Team:
"Digital transformation equates to understanding old processes and transforming them into more efficient, digital equivalents. Most (83%) respondents in the 2025 report cite analytical thinking and communications/teamwork as the most important skills for new workers."

At Oppr, we build tools for the shop floor, not the boardroom. Our platform empowers frontline workers—the true experts—to capture data, access knowledge, and solve problems in real-time. By focusing on human-centric AI, we help manufacturing SMEs make technology a practical tool for everyday improvement.
